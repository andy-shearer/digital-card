# Scrimba 'Learn React' Section 1 Solo Project:
## _"Build a React info site"_

I created this solo project to practice the beginner React concepts that were covered in section one
of the course. The code was written within the Scrimba environment and is really easy to check it
in your own browser here: https://scrimba.com/scrim/co4aa4ca1bfbec6c22efd7009

## Improvements
Some improvements I feel could be made when I progress further through the React course:
* Add event handlers to the various buttons so that they actually open the appropriate links
* Refactor the _About_ and _Interests_ components to handle dynamic content provided to them to reduce
  duplicated code
* Tidy up the CSS
* Fix tiny margin between image and summary panels

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
